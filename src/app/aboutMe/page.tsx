              <p>
                Since 2014, I have forged my path as a software developer,
                covering all aspects of the software lifecycle: from programming
                and testing to architectural design and project management. My
                career has focused on web technologies such as PHP, JavaScript,
                and TypeScript, evolving in recent years towards serverless
                cloud-native applications with AWS.

                combining solid fundamentals with the latest innovations to
                create efficient and scalable solutions.
